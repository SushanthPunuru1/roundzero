an entry in the same PR.

---

**001 · 2026-07 · Terminal-first labs; desktop streaming deferred.**
Linux CyberPatriot work is ~95% CLI and principle #1 is Chromebook-first.
xterm.js/ttyd sessions cut per-session RAM/bandwidth ~10x, remove desktop
image maintenance, and speed cold starts. noVNC desktops revisit post-season.

**002 · 2026-07 · Single Next.js app; no separate API service in Phase 1.**
Server actions + route handlers on Vercel cover all Phase 1 surface. The
Phase 2 orchestrator becomes the first separate service because it must run
on the lab box. Avoids double deploys/costs now. Consequence: keep domain
logic in importable modules so extraction stays cheap.

**003 · 2026-07 · Agent + injector in Go; everything else TypeScript.**
Static binary drops into any lab container with zero runtime deps; the same
codebase cross-compiles to the Phase 4 Windows local agent. aeacus's YAML
check format is the design reference (clean-room implementation, no code
reuse — license separation).

**004 · 2026-07 · Better Auth (Google + magic link via Resend), organization
plugin; one organization == one team.** Ships teams, roles, and invitations
nearly out of the box. Join-by-code implemented on top (code column on the
team). "Student belongs to ≤ 1 team" enforced in app logic. School-level
organizations deferred; will layer above teams later.

**005 · 2026-07 · ts-fsrs for spaced repetition, not hand-rolled SM-2.**
Better retention math, maintained library, pure logic we can unit-test.

**006 · 2026-07 · Canonical skill taxonomy as the data spine.**
`packages/content/taxonomy/taxonomy.yaml` with stable dotted IDs
(`linux.pam.pwquality`). Lessons, checklist items, drill cards, vuln
templates, debrief lines, and mastery all reference node IDs. IDs are never
renamed — deprecate and add. DB holds a synced index; YAML is truth.

**007 · 2026-07 · Content-as-code.** Lessons (MDX), checklists, drill
cards, taxonomy live in `packages/content`, synced to DB by an idempotent
script. Enables community PRs later and keeps DB rebuildable.

**008 · 2026-07 · Design direction: precision instrument.** Dark-first,
deep neutral base, signal-amber accent, mono as brand material. Green/red
reserved exclusively for scoring semantics. Full system in `DESIGN.md`.
Rejected: hacker green-on-black (cliché, hurts coach trust), default
shadcn look (drift).

**009 · 2026-07 · Deferred list.** Redis, R2, Grafana/Prometheus,
Terraform/Ansible, school orgs, mentor role, Discord, season ladder, AI
tutor, placement micro-task, desktop streaming — all deliberately parked
until something forces them. Rationale: solo builder, season deadline,
free-tier budget.

**010 · 2026-07 · Product renamed CyberRange → RoundZero.** Working
title replaced everywhere it appeared (`CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/spec.md`, schema/taxonomy header comments). No
functional change.

**011 · 2026-07 · Monorepo scaffolded: pnpm workspaces, no Turborepo
yet.** `apps/web` (Next.js 16 App Router, TS strict), `packages/{db,ui,
content}`. Root scripts shell out via `pnpm --filter`/`pnpm -r`; a build
orchestrator (Turborepo/Nx) is unnecessary at this package count and
adds config surface — revisit if build graph complexity grows.
Tailwind v4 config is CSS-first (`@theme` in `globals.css`), no
`tailwind.config.js`. shadcn/ui wired in monorepo mode: `components.json`
lives in `packages/ui` (the single target for generated primitives, per
`CLAUDE.md` rule 3); `apps/web` consumes it via `transpilePackages`.
Only `Button` built this session as a wiring proof — the rest of the
`packages/ui` v1 inventory (`DESIGN.md`) lands with the milestone work
that needs it. Prisma pinned to `6.19.2` (not the newly-`latest` 7.x)
to match the already-committed `schema.prisma`'s `prisma-client-js`
generator without forcing a schema rewrite mid-scaffold. ESLint 9 flat
config at the root plus Next's own generated config in `apps/web`
(pinned at 9, not the newly-`latest` 10 — `eslint-plugin-react`, pulled
in by `eslint-config-next`, throws on ESLint 10's runtime API as of
this writing);
Vitest per-package, proven with one smoke test in `packages/db`. CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `prisma generate`/lint/test/build only
— no `prisma migrate dev` against the real Neon DB, in CI or during
scaffolding, since that's a live shared resource and creating the
initial migration belongs with next session's auth/teams work.

**012 · 2026-07 · Switzer/IBM Plex Mono not yet self-hosted.**
`globals.css` wires the `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` token names to
system-font fallback stacks with a TODO. Fetching and licensing the
actual Fontshare/IBM Plex Mono font files is follow-up work, not
something to fetch from a third-party CDN unattended during scaffolding.

**013 · 2026-07 · Design exploration verdict. Precision-instrument
hypothesis VALIDATED — all strong outputs stayed inside DESIGN.md
tokens. Adopted: (a) 2a 'flight recorder' as the Phase 2 debrief-page
target: run-trajectory chart (points over elapsed time, penalty drops,
critical-service outage bands), timestamped event log, gauge strip
incl. critical-service uptime %, seed shown in header. Chart is
enhancement only — the event log is the at-rest source of truth; all
chart/log interactions require keyboard parity. Phase 2 data
requirement: persist per-check timestamps and critical-service uptime.
(b) 1b 'field datasheet' (warm light assessment-record) as the
PRINT-SURFACE identity for checklist export and readiness PDF.

**014 · 2026-07 · Better Auth wired live: pinned dependency versions +
magic-link sender.** `better-auth@1.6.23`, `@better-auth/cli@1.4.21` (dev
dep, used one-off for schema generation, not a persistent script),
`resend@6.17.2`, `zod@4.4.3`. Extends 004 (Google + magic link via Resend,
organization plugin, one org == one team) with concrete versions. Magic-link
sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's shared dev sender) for now —
it only delivers to the Resend account owner, which is enough to prove the
flow end to end; swap for a verified domain sender before onboarding real
users. `user`/`organization`/`member` APP FIELDS (see schema.prisma) are
declared as Better Auth `additionalFields` with `input: false` so they can
never be set through the public auth API — they stay system/coach-owned.
Reconciled the hand-written Prisma schema against `@better-auth/cli
generate` output (run against a scratch file, never applied directly): the
generator agreed with every hand-written model and APP FIELD; the only
real delta was a missing `@@index([identifier])` on `Verification`, now
added. First migration (`init_auth`) applied to the dev Neon DB.

**015 · 2026-07 · `dotenv-cli` added to load the root `.env` for local-only,
DB/env-dependent scripts.** Next.js and the Prisma CLI only read `.env`
files from their own package directory, not a monorepo root, so
`apps/web`'s `dev` script and `packages/db`'s `migrate`/`seed` scripts
couldn't see the root `.env` (`prisma validate` failed with "Environment
variable not found" before this). Wrapped only those three scripts with
`dotenv -e ../../.env --`; deliberately left `generate` (packages/db) and
`build`/`test` (apps/web) untouched since CI invokes them with real env
vars injected directly, not a `.env` file, and requiring one would break
CI. Root `.env` stays the single source of truth — no duplicated secrets.

**016 · 2026-07 · Team create/join/roster built as Prisma-direct server
actions, not the organization plugin's REST endpoints.** Extends 004.
The plugin's default RBAC (owner/admin/member) and invitation flow don't
match our coach/captain/member roles or join-by-code UX, and 004 already
scoped join-by-code and the one-team-per-user rule as app logic on top of
the plugin's schema — so `createTeam`/`joinTeam`/roster-management actions
write `Organization`/`Member` via Prisma directly, gated by
`auth.api.getSession` + a hand-rolled permission check
(`apps/web/src/lib/teams.ts`), instead of `auth.api.createOrganization` /
`addMember`. `auth.ts` is untouched. A user's team is resolved by
`Member.userId` (at most one row, per 004), so `Session.activeOrganizationId`
stays unused this milestone — revisit if we ever need multi-team switching.
No new dependency: the machine-role/division pickers are a tokenized native
`<select>` (`packages/ui` `Select`) and member removal uses an inline
two-step confirm, both avoiding Radix Select/Dialog. Added to
`packages/ui`: `Card`, `Badge`, `Select`, `PageHeader` (DESIGN.md v1
inventory, tokenized, no new colors). `packages/db` now re-exports the
`Division`/`MachineRole` Prisma enums so `apps/web` doesn't need its own
`@prisma/client` dependency just for types.

**017 · 2026-07 · Three bugs fixed post-016: roster machine-role revert,
magic-link always-invalid, Google sign-in dropping the account name.**

*Machine-role revert.* The DB write always succeeded (confirmed by querying
Postgres directly after the action); the select just visually snapped back.
Root cause was two-layered: react-dom calls `requestFormReset` as part of
submitting any `<form action={fn}>` (`startHostTransition` in
react-dom-client), which does a native `HTMLFormElement.reset()` — that
resets *every* control in the form back to its HTML-declared default
(first `<option>`, here "Unassigned") regardless of React's `value` prop,
because it bypasses React's reconciliation entirely. Making the `<select>`
controlled alone didn't fix it (verified: still reverted) since React only
re-writes a controlled value when its own `value` prop differs from the
prior *render*, and the native reset happens outside that diff. Fix: the
machine-role control no longer renders a `<form action={fn}>` submitted via
`requestSubmit()` — it calls the `useActionState` dispatch function directly
from `onChange` (wrapped in `startTransition`, since the dispatch isn't
auto-transitioned outside a form/button `action` prop), which never invokes
`startHostTransition`'s reset path. Promote/remove kept their `<form>`s —
their only field is a `value`-controlled hidden input, immune to this.
Added `apps/web/src/app/app/team/roster-table.test.tsx`
(`@testing-library/react` + `jsdom`, new devDependencies — free/MIT, no
Next-specific test runner existed for component-level React behavior)
asserting the select keeps a newly-chosen value after the mocked action
resolves; confirmed it fails against the pre-fix code before restoring the
fix, so it's a real regression guard.

*Magic link always `INVALID_TOKEN`.* The email pointed straight at the
API's GET verify endpoint, which consumes the (single-use) token on the
first request to it — email clients and corporate gateways routinely
prefetch/scan links before the user clicks, consuming it first. Fixed by
routing the email link at a new app page (`/magic-link`) instead; the
token-consuming fetch now happens from client-side JS on user page-load
(`magic-link-confirm.tsx`), which scanners generally don't execute. Verified
directly: a plain `curl` GET against the new link left the token unconsumed
in `Verification`; a real (JS-executing) browser hit afterward still signed
in successfully. The confirm page omits `callbackURL` on its own verify
call specifically because Better Auth returns JSON instead of redirecting
when it's absent (`callback.mjs`) — that's what lets success/failure be
told apart from `fetch` without following/parsing a redirect. Guarded with
a `useRef` against React Strict Mode's dev double-invoke of effects, which
would otherwise burn the token on the throwaway first pass.
`buildMagicLinkConfirmUrl` (`auth-helpers.ts`) is unit-tested.

**018 · 2026-07 · `yaml` (eemeli, MIT) added to `packages/db`, pinned to
`2.9.0`.** Needed to parse `packages/content/taxonomy/taxonomy.yaml` for the
taxonomy sync script (`prisma/seed.ts`, wired to `pnpm db:seed`), which
replaces the seed stub left in place during scaffolding (011). Ships its own
TS types, so no `@types` package. Parsing and validation
(`src/taxonomy/parse.ts`: dotted-id format, no duplicate ids, parent-prefix
consistency, skill `level` required/valid) and the create/update/deprecate
diff against existing rows (`src/taxonomy/reconcile.ts`) are pure functions,
unit-tested without touching the DB; `prisma/seed.ts` is the thin glue that
reads the file, calls both, and applies the plan in a transaction (creates
ordered DOMAIN → CATEGORY → SKILL so the self-referential `parentId` FK is
always satisfied). No `zod`: the cross-reference checks here are custom logic
either way, and hand-rolled `TaxonomyError` messages keep `packages/db`
dependency-light. Per DECISIONS 006, a `SkillNode` id absent from the YAML is
marked `deprecated: true`, never deleted; a deprecated id that reappears is
un-deprecated. Verified against the dev Neon DB: first run created all 108
rows (7 domains + 22 categories + 79 skills, matching the file); a second run
reported all 108 as unchanged, proving idempotency.

*Google sign-in showing email instead of name.* Confirmed in the dev DB:
the account had `providers: ["google"]` but `name: ""`. Better Auth only
writes `name`/`image` from a social profile at first user creation
(`handleOAuthUserInfo`); an existing user (e.g. one first created nameless
via magic link) never gets it backfilled on a later Google sign-in unless
`overrideUserInfoOnSignIn: true` is set on the provider — added to
`socialProviders.google` in `auth.ts`. Self-heals on next Google sign-in;
not independently unit-tested (would require mocking Better Auth's OAuth
callback flow, out of proportion to a one-line config fix) — verified by
source tracing (`@better-auth/core` `google.ts` / `link-account.mjs`)
since real Google OAuth can't be driven headlessly here.

**019 · 2026-07 · Visual craft pass: persistent app shell + screen-craft
checklist codified.** Every `/app` page used to build its own chrome (a
repeated eyebrow + sign-out button) with no shared frame or max-width. Added
`apps/web/src/app/app/layout.tsx` (session check + `TopBar`, ~1100px centered
container) as the single shell for all `/app` routes; `TopBar`
(`app/top-bar.tsx`) carries the wordmark, a path-derived breadcrumb, and
account controls, with room left for a future ⌘K search (not built). New
`packages/ui` primitives, tokenized, no new colors: `Avatar` (deterministic
initials, `--surface-2`/`--hairline`, never a hashed color) and
`StatStrip`/`Stat` (the DECISIONS 013 gauge-strip style: eyebrow label over a
mono `tabular-nums` value). `/app/team` gained a stat strip (members, roles
filled, division) and an n=1 "invite panel" moment instead of a one-row
table; roster rows got avatars, a hover surface step, and an em dash instead
of a blank Actions cell. Codified the standard as a "Screen craft checklist"
appended to `DESIGN.md`, referenced from `CLAUDE.md`'s Design section so
future sessions are gated on it. No server action, auth, or Prisma schema
changes; no new dependency. Verified with Playwright screenshots (browser
fetched ephemerally via `npx`, not added to any `package.json`) of the public
landing/sign-in routes plus a temporary, uncommitted preview route exercising
the same prop-driven components the real `/app`/`/app/team` pages compose
(those pages are session-gated server components, so Playwright can't
navigate to them directly without a seeded session).

**020 · 2026-07 · MDX lesson pipeline: `next-mdx-remote`, lesson sync, and
check-grading design.** Milestone 1's final item. Added
`next-mdx-remote@6.0.0` (new dependency) — its `/rsc` export compiles MDX to
React inside a Server Component at request time, which we need since a
lesson is read as data by slug rather than statically imported the way
`@next/mdx` expects; peer `react >=16`, built on `@mdx-js/mdx@3`, no
syntax-highlighting plugin added (commands are short shell lines styled in
mono via a component map, kept the dep surface minimal). `packages/db/src/lessons/`
mirrors the taxonomy module (`parse` / `grade` / `reconcile`, pure and
unit-tested): frontmatter is validated against the `packages/content/lessons/README.md`
contract and `validateSkillRefs` fails the whole seed run loudly if a
lesson's `domainId` or any `skills[]` id isn't a real taxonomy node — the
spine (CLAUDE.md rule 2) must hold for lessons too. `prisma/seed.ts` now
syncs `Lesson`/`LessonSkill` the same idempotent way as `SkillNode`, after
taxonomy sync so skill refs can be validated against the just-synced set.
Deliberately no `check` column on `Lesson`: check questions live only in
MDX frontmatter and are re-read + re-parsed server-side on every grading
submission, so the answer key never ships to the client — `apps/web`'s
`LessonCheck` client component only ever receives `{ q, options }`, and the
`submitCheck` server action returns per-question correct/incorrect + `why`,
never which option was correct. Retakes are unlimited; `LessonProgress.checkScore`
keeps the best attempt (`bestScore` in `packages/db/src/lessons/grade.ts`).
Lesson MDX is read from `packages/content` at request time via `node:fs`
(same content-stays-out-of-apps/web rule as the taxonomy YAML), so
`next.config.ts` gained `outputFileTracingRoot` (monorepo root) and
`outputFileTracingIncludes` pinning `packages/content/lessons/**/*.mdx` into
the Vercel function bundle for the `/app/lessons` routes — unverified on
Vercel itself (no deploy access from this session), but confirmed locally: a
production `next build` (with env loaded) compiles both routes and a
standalone `compileMDX` smoke test against all three lesson bodies produces
the expected heading/code-block counts. All three Foundations lessons
(`reading-a-readme`, `scoring-engine`, `safe-change-discipline`) flipped to
`published: true` — editorial sign-off given. Verified end to end: `pnpm
db:seed` created all three lessons on first run and reported all-unchanged
on a second run; temporarily pointing a skill ref at a nonexistent id made
the seed fail loudly with exit code 1, as required, then reverted; a
disposable-user integration script exercised the exact `LessonProgress`
upsert the server action performs and confirmed retakes never lower the
saved score. Full interactive browser click-through (open a lesson, answer
the check, see the score persist across refresh) was not done in this
session — no browser automation tool was available, and creating a real
session requires either a live magic-link email round-trip or dumping
session tokens from the DB, which this session's sandboxing correctly
refused as credential materialization. A human should do one manual
click-through before relying on this in production.

**021 · 2026-07 · Deploy prep: fixed the 020 follow-up build bug, added
postinstall `prisma generate`.** Root cause of "plain `pnpm build` fails
locally on missing `RESEND_API_KEY`": `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`
constructed `new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)` at module scope: the
`Resend` constructor throws synchronously when the key is falsy, and
`auth.ts` is imported (module-evaluated, not just type-imported) by every
route that touches auth, so `next build`'s page-data collection crashed
building `/api/auth/[...all]` — confirmed by reproducing the exact
stack trace with no env vars set. Fixed by constructing `Resend` inside
the `sendMagicLink` callback instead (request-time, only runs when an
email actually sends), matching the lazy-read approach `CLAUDE.md`
prescribes; no dotenv wrapper needed since the real fix removes the
import-time read. The other `auth.ts` env reads (`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`,
`BETTER_AUTH_URL`, Google client id/secret) stay at module scope —
Better Auth only logs a warning/catches internally for those when unset,
it doesn't throw, so build-time collection survives; verified by building
with zero env vars set (exit 0, only warnings). Also added a `postinstall`
script (`prisma generate`) to `packages/db/package.json` so a fresh
install — Vercel or CI — always produces a client, instead of relying on
`build`/`generate` being invoked first; `prisma`/`@prisma/client` builds
were already allow-listed in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; confirmed by installing
after Prisma reported "Lockfile is up to date" and still needing zero
manual steps: `packages/db postinstall$ prisma generate` ran automatically.
Verified end to end the way Vercel actually builds: ran `pnpm build`
(root, which chains `db generate` then `next build`) with all six env
vars injected directly into the process environment (not the app's own
dotenv), and separately with none set at all — both exit 0. `pnpm lint`
and `pnpm test` (88 tests across `packages/db`/`apps/web`) also pass. No
production validation was weakened — this only changed when a value is
read, not whether it's required at runtime.

**022 · 2026-07 · Milestone 2: checklist + Season sync, read-only render.**
Synced the two already-authored canonical checklists (`packages/content/
checklists/{linux,windows}-core.yaml`, 47 items total) into `ChecklistTemplate`/
`ChecklistItem` and rendered them. Extends 006/007/018/020 — same pattern:
`packages/db/src/checklists/{parse,reconcile}.ts` pure and unit-tested,
`prisma/seed.ts` the thin glue, syncing after taxonomy + lessons so
`skillNodeId`/`lessonSlug` refs validate against the just-synced sets.

*Schema.* `ChecklistItem` gained `caution String?` via an additive migration
(`add_checklist_item_caution`) — the content contract already specified an
optional caution field (none of the 47 items use it yet) but the column
didn't exist. Season `cp-19` ("CyberPatriot XIX") is seeded as a minimal row
(`syncSeason()`, upsert) so the templates' FK resolves; `SeasonEvent` rows
(Appendix B calendar) wait for Milestone 4 coach planning.

*Removed items are deleted, not soft-hidden.* Unlike `SkillNode` (deprecate,
never delete — 006), a `ChecklistItem` whose id drops out of the YAML is
deleted outright. `ChecklistItem` has no soft-hide column, and canonical
items carry no user data yet — team forks (`TeamChecklistItem`, not built
until next session) are separate rows, so nothing downstream references a
canonical item by FK. Content-as-code means the DB is a rebuildable index;
the lesson sync sets the same precedent (020).

*jsonb key order.* Postgres jsonb does not preserve object key order, so
`commands` equality in `reconcile.ts` compares key/value pairs
(`sameCommands`), never `JSON.stringify` identity — confirmed against the
real dev DB: a second `db:seed` run reported all 47 items unchanged despite
the round trip through jsonb storage.

*Detail-page sectioning.* Items render in authored `sortOrder` — never
reordered, since the order itself is operational intent (e.g. `login-defs`
deliberately follows the PAM cluster to complete the password-policy arc).
Section headers come from contiguous taxonomy-category runs
(`groupItemsIntoSections`, `apps/web/src/lib/checklists.ts`): a new header on
category change; a header that recurs later reads `"{Category} — continued"`;
a single-item run on its *first* occurrence renders headerless (the item's own
category chip already carries identity) and is skipped by the TOC, but a
single-item *recurrence* still gets the `"— continued"` header since that
signal is the useful one. The sticky mini-TOC (`md:sticky`, collapses to a
stacked block below `md`/768px — real Chromebook viewports run ≥1024px, so
the sticky two-column layout is the normal case) lists only header-bearing
runs.

*One authorized content fix.* `linux-core.yaml`'s `weak-passwords` item
pointed `skillNodeId` at `windows.users-groups.weak-passwords` — a Linux item
referencing a Windows taxonomy node, flagged during this session's ref
validation. Changed to `linux.accounts.passwd-shadow`; this also happens to
join that item into the contiguous Linux Accounts run instead of leaving an
orphan single-item cross-OS section.

No new dependency (`yaml` already in `packages/db` per 018). Verified end to
end against the dev Neon DB: `db:seed` created 2 templates + 47 items; a
second run reported all-unchanged; temporarily pointing an item's
`skillNodeId` at a nonexistent id failed the run with exit 1 and a precise
message, then reverted. `pnpm test` (179 tests across `packages/db`/
`apps/web`) and `pnpm lint` pass. Full interactive verification (both pages,
copy-to-clipboard, section/TOC behavior, focus rings, and no horizontal
overflow at mobile/tablet/Chromebook widths) was done via a temporary,
uncommitted preview route rendering the real prop-driven components against
real seeded data — same approach as 019, deleted before commit since
`/app/checklists*` are session-gated and no browser-automatable session
exists in this sandbox.

**023 · 2026-07 · Fixed Vercel prod build failure: stale cached Prisma
Client survives a no-op install.** `dd5ade6`'s `caution` column (022) built
and typechecked locally but failed on Vercel: `Type error: Property
'caution' does not exist on type ...` in `app/checklists/[id]/page.tsx`.
Root cause: Prisma's default generator output lands inside `node_modules`
(`node_modules/.prisma/client`, no custom `output` path in
`schema.prisma`), which Vercel restores wholesale from its build cache
across deployments. `packages/db`'s `postinstall` (021) only fires when
pnpm actually changes something during install; a cache-restored,
lockfile-unchanged install is a no-op — pnpm logs "Already up to date" and
never re-invokes lifecycle scripts — so the client generated *before* the
`caution` migration survives untouched into a build of a commit that
requires it. Reproduced exactly outside Vercel: cloned the repo to a
scratch dir, `pnpm install` (fresh, postinstall generates a correct
client), regenerated the client against a schema with `caution` stripped
(simulating the pre-migration cached client), restored the real schema,
ran a second `pnpm install` (logged "Already up to date," confirmed no
regeneration), then `next build` with zero env vars in the process
environment (no `.env` file) — reproduced the identical type error at the
identical line. Fix: `apps/web`'s own `build` script now runs
`pnpm --filter @roundzero/db run generate` before `next build`, so
generation is part of the build path itself, not a side effect of
install — this holds regardless of Vercel's install-caching behavior or
whether Vercel invokes the root `pnpm build` chain (021) or `apps/web`'s
script directly (a monorepo project's Root Directory setting can call
either). Confirmed the fix against the same reproduced-stale-client
clone: identical no-op install, then `pnpm run build` regenerated the
client and completed with exit 0. `postinstall` (021) is kept as-is — it
still helps fresh installs and local `pnpm install` — but is no longer
load-bearing for prod builds. The generated client was already fully
covered by the blanket `node_modules` entry in `.gitignore`; since no
`output` override exists in `schema.prisma`, nothing generated is or was
ever tracked in git. Re-verified the 021 dotenv guarantee is still intact
while here: neither `apps/web`'s `build` nor `packages/db`'s `generate`
wraps `dotenv -e ../../.env` (only `dev`/`migrate`/`seed` do, per 015),
so this fix does not reintroduce a hard `.env`-file dependency in the
build path. `pnpm build`/`lint`/`test` all still pass locally.

**024 · 2026-07 · Milestone 3: SRS daily drill.** Wired the 55 drill cards
(`packages/content/cards/core.yaml`) and ts-fsrs scheduling (blessed by 005)
into a `/app/drill` surface. Extends the content-as-code pattern (006/007)
and the pure-parse/reconcile/glue split used by taxonomy/lessons/checklists.

*Card sync — deactivate, never delete.* `packages/db/src/cards/{parse,
reconcile}.ts`, wired into `prisma/seed.ts` after checklist sync. Unlike
checklist items (022, hard-delete, no user data), a `DrillCard` dropped from
the YAML is soft-deactivated (`active: false`) because `UserCardState`/
`ReviewLog` rows reference it and carry a student's review history — this
follows `SkillNode`'s deprecate-never-delete pattern (006) instead. A card
that reappears is reactivated and its content refreshed. `skillNodeId` is
validated against the taxonomy the same way checklist items are (must
resolve to a leaf `SKILL` node).

*ts-fsrs `5.4.1`, added to `packages/db`.* `packages/db/src/srs/schedule.ts`
is a thin, unit-tested wrapper — the scheduling math is never hand-rolled.
Its entire job is mapping between ts-fsrs's snake_case `Card` shape
(`elapsed_days`, `scheduled_days`, `learning_steps`, `last_review`) and
`UserCardState`'s camelCase columns, so nothing outside `packages/db`
imports ts-fsrs directly (`Rating`/`CardState`/`newCardState`/
`scheduleReview` are re-exported from `client.ts`). Probing the library
directly (`fsrs().next(card, now, rating)`) showed it tracks a
`learning_steps` field (position within the learning/relearning step
sequence) that the original schema didn't persist — round-tripping without
it would silently reset a card to the first learning step on every review,
so `UserCardState.learningSteps Int @default(0)` was added alongside
`createdAt DateTime @default(now())` (needed for the daily new-card cap
below) in one additive migration, `add_usercardstate_createdat_and_
learningsteps`.

*New-card introduction, two paths.* (a) Completing a lesson
(`enqueueLessonCards`, called from `submitCheck` in
`apps/web/src/app/app/lessons/[slug]/actions.ts`) enqueues every active card
for that lesson's skill nodes the user doesn't already have a
`UserCardState` for — immediate, not subject to the cap, since it's an
explicit signal and a lesson maps to only a handful of cards. (b) A capped
daily Foundations batch (`DAILY_NEW_CARD_CAP = 10`,
`packages/db/src/srs/day.ts`) tops up new cards from the Foundations domain
whenever the drill loads, so a student with zero completed lessons still has
something to drill. Both paths are idempotent
(`createMany`/`skipDuplicates` against the `(userId, cardId)` unique
constraint) and the selection itself is pure/unit-tested
(`packages/db/src/srs/select.ts`).

*Day boundary: fixed `America/New_York`, not per-user.* No per-user
timezone is stored (data minimization, CLAUDE.md rule 8: no unnecessary
PII). Both the streak and the daily new-card cap need a "local day"
boundary, so `PLATFORM_TIME_ZONE = "America/New_York"` (CyberPatriot is a US
competition) is threaded through as a parameter everywhere day-boundary math
happens, rather than hardcoded inline — swapping in a per-user timezone
later is a config change at each call site, not a data migration. The
streak in particular (`packages/db/src/srs/streak.ts`, `computeStreak`) is
**always derived at read time from raw `ReviewLog.reviewedAt` timestamps**
passed in by the caller — never a stored/cached streak counter — precisely
so that swap stays cheap. **Known edge case:** a west-coast student drilling
late evening can have a review land just past the Eastern-time midnight
boundary from their own perspective and see a streak break unfairly (or,
symmetrically, get day-boundary credit earlier than their own local day
actually turned over). **Revisit trigger:** first sustained non-Eastern user
base — i.e. the Phase 2 external-user gate (spec Phase 2 gate: "25 external
users complete a lab") — not before; the whole point of the parameterized
design above is that this fix is additive when it comes.

*Drill surface.* `/app/drill` (`apps/web/src/app/app/drill/{page,actions}
.tsx`, `drill-session.tsx`): due count + streak in a `StatStrip`, one card
at a time, space to reveal / 1-4 to rate (keyboard-first per CLAUDE.md rule
5), COMMAND backs in mono. Rating buttons deliberately do **not** use
`--score`/`--penalty` (DESIGN.md: scoring-semantics-only) — a drill rating
is a memory-recall signal, not a competition score. Added `EmptyState`
(icon, one sentence, one action) to `packages/ui` — it was already in the
DESIGN.md v1 inventory (Milestone 1, still unbuilt) and is genuinely
reusable, not one-off. `apps/web/src/app/app/layout.tsx` queries a cheap
due-card count for the nav badge on every `/app` page load; the actual
new-card top-up only runs when `/app/drill` itself loads, to avoid a write
on every navigation.

No other new dependency. `pnpm test`/`lint` pass; `pnpm db:seed` run twice
locally confirmed idempotency (create once, all-unchanged second run).

**025 · 2026-07 · Fixed a production bug: `/app/drill` could show "all
caught up" while cards were still genuinely due.** `DrillSession`
(`apps/web/src/app/app/drill/drill-session.tsx`) tracked its position with a
plain `index` against the `queue` prop it received from the server. Rating a
card calls the `rateCard` server action, which calls `revalidatePath("/app/
drill")` — Next.js then automatically re-renders the parent Server
Component (`page.tsx`, which re-runs `loadDrill()`) and passes a freshly
re-fetched, **shrunken** `queue` array back down into the already-mounted
client component on every single rating. Since `index` kept incrementing by
1 per rating while the live array kept shrinking by 1 (the just-rated card
dropping out), the two drifted apart: `queue[index]` silently skipped
ahead, and `done = index >= queue.length` could go true well before every
card the session started with had actually been rated — stranding the
skipped cards as still due. Reproduced deterministically with a React
Testing Library regression test (`drill-session.test.tsx`) that rates one
card, then re-renders the component with a shrunk `queue` prop (simulating
the exact revalidation-driven re-render) — confirmed it fails against the
pre-fix code (jumps straight to "Card 2 of 2" / the wrong card, skipping
one entirely) before restoring the fix.

*Fix.* `DrillSession` now freezes its queue once via `useRef` on mount and
never resyncs from the `queue` prop again — a drill session always works
through the exact batch (due cards + that load's daily top-up, already
combined by `loadDrill` before the queue is returned) it started with,
regardless of how many times the parent re-renders behind it. New cards
introduced by a later top-up surface on the next page load, not
mid-session. `rateCard` now also calls `revalidatePath("/app", "layout")`
(previously only the page) so the nav due-count badge
(`apps/web/src/app/app/layout.tsx`'s `countDueCards`) updates live as the
user rates, instead of only on the next hard navigation — with the client
fix in place this can no longer desync the empty-state check. Verified with
a disposable-user integration script (drain to zero) that `loadDrill`'s
`dueCount`, its `queue.length`, and `countDueCards`'s badge query all agree
at 0 after a full session — confirming the data layer was never the
problem, only the client's index/array desync was.

*Copy/UX: the drill wasn't teaching that it's self-graded recall, not a
quiz.* After reveal, the four rating buttons now show their meaning, not
just their name — "1 Again — Didn't recall it", "2 Hard — Recalled, but it
was a struggle", "3 Good — Recalled it correctly", "4 Easy — Recalled it
instantly" — under a "How well did you know it?" eyebrow, still clickable
and keyboard 1-4. The page intro now states the model directly: "Recall the
answer, reveal it, then rate how well you knew it — you're grading your own
memory, not taking a quiz." No new `--score`/`--penalty` use (still
neutral/accent tokens only, per DESIGN.md). No new dependency.

**026 · 2026-07 · Phase 2 kickoff: agent/ Go module, check-file schema,
merged-config decision, linux-practice vulnerable image.** First Phase 2
build (extends 003's "agent + injector in Go" decision with the concrete
schema/implementation). Everything runs locally against Docker; no
orchestrator, browser terminal, or lab-container lifecycle work yet — those
stay ROADMAP Phase 2 items for later sessions.

*Check-file schema.* One `type` + `params` per check, dispatched through a
`internal/checks` registry (`schema.go`/`registry.go`) — deliberately no
`all:`/`any:` composition; every one of the first 10 planted vulns needs
exactly one condition, and adding real composition ahead of a genuine need
would be exactly the kind of premature abstraction CLAUDE.md warns against.
7 check types shipped (`file_contains`, `file_mode`, `user`, `command`,
`service`, `package`, `sshd_config`), each a registered `Evaluator` over an
`internal/system.System` interface (`ReadFile`/`Mode`/`Run`) with a `Fake`
implementation, so every check type's evaluation logic is pure and
unit-tested without Docker or a Linux box. aeacus's YAML format remains
design-reference only (003) — this schema and its Go implementation are
clean-room.

*Merged-config decision.* The `sshd_config` check type evaluates `sshd -T`
(sshd's own merged/effective config) and never greps the raw file. Ubuntu
puts `Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf` as literally the first line of
`sshd_config`, and sshd applies first-match-wins per directive, so a
drop-in (the real Ubuntu 24.04 cloud-init pattern) can silently override
anything the main file says — grepping the main file alone would produce
both false negatives (a valid fix landed in the drop-in) and false
positives (main file looks hardened, a drop-in overrides it). The
`linux-practice` image's `ssh-permitrootlogin` check plants exactly this
trap; `agent/scripts/prove.sh` state 4 proves a drop-in-only fix is
credited, and a bonus demo proves a main-file-only edit is correctly still
failing.

*`service` check without a booted init.* Containers here never run systemd
as PID 1 (no `--privileged`, no cgroup mounts, no boot race — considered and
rejected as unnecessary complexity for what "enabled/disabled" actually
needs). `systemctl --root=/ is-enabled <unit>` is systemd's own documented
offline mode (used by chroot/image-building tools like mkosi/debootstrap):
it reads unit/`.wants` symlinks directly from the filesystem, never talks to
a running PID 1 or D-Bus. Sufficient for every check planted so far (only
enabled/disabled, never live active/running state); live active-state
polling is a real future requirement (Phase 2 debrief's critical-service
uptime %, DECISIONS 013) deferred until the orchestrator runs boot-capable
lab containers — noted as a known scope limit in `agent/README.md`, not a
bug.

*`agent/` Go module.* `github.com/roundzero/agent`, Go 1.23, one dependency:
`gopkg.in/yaml.v3` (MIT, compiled into a static `CGO_ENABLED=0` binary — zero
runtime deps). No local Go install is assumed anywhere in this repo or CI —
build/vet/test all run inside a `golang:1.23` container
(`agent/scripts/prove.sh`, and a new parallel `agent` job in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` using `actions/setup-go`, independent of the
existing pnpm/Next.js job).

*`linux-practice` vulnerable image + proof harness.* `agent/image/Dockerfile`
(`ubuntu:24.04`) plants 10 vulns spanning every category in
`packages/content/checklists/linux-core.yaml` (accounts, PAM, SSH,
services/persistence, file perms, updates/firewall) plus 2 zero-point decoy
checks proving the engine respects an authorization model instead of
blanket-flagging (an odd-named but authorized sudoer; a required service
staying enabled). `agent/image/answer-key.yaml` is the machine-readable
manifest (distinct from `agent/checks/linux-practice.yaml`, the engine's
actual scoring input) — every planted vuln's category/points/skillNode/
remediation, kept in lockstep by hand per `agent/README.md`'s "how to add a
vuln" process (Dockerfile injection + fix script + check entry + answer-key
entry, no engine changes). `agent/scripts/prove.sh` builds the agent (in a
`golang` container) and the image, then runs all four states from a fresh
container each time — fresh vulnerable (0/100, exactly the 10 vulns fail),
fully hardened (100/100), half-fixed (exactly the sum of 5 chosen fixes, no
partial credit), and the alternate SSH fix (drop-in only, 12/100) — grepping
each JSON report's totals and self-asserting every expected number (exit
non-zero on any mismatch), plus the bonus main-file-only demo above.
Containers run with `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_RAW` (not
`--privileged`): `ufw enable`'s iptables/nftables rule loading and network
sysctls need these even outside a booted init, and the real orchestrator
will need to grant lab containers the same for students to run `ufw enable`
themselves. `RUN mkdir -p /run/sshd` in the Dockerfile is required for
`sshd -T` to run at all in this environment — that directory is normally
created by systemd-tmpfiles at boot, which never happens here. Verified end
to end: `go vet`/`go test ./...` (32 unit tests) green inside a
`golang:1.23` container; `agent/scripts/prove.sh` passes all four states +
the bonus demo against real Docker Desktop, self-asserted, exit 0.

**027 · 2026-07 · In-browser lab terminal: `lab-broker/` (Node/TS, standalone)
+ `TerminalFrame`/`ScoreLine` in `packages/ui` + `/app/lab`. Local-only.**
The first end-to-end Phase 2 loop a student actually touches: launch a
practice lab, get a live root shell in the `linux-practice` container from
inside the browser, harden it, click Score, see the report. Scope
deliberately stayed local + single-lab (no multi-tenant isolation, gVisor,
pooling, or cloud — those are the orchestrator, a later session).

*Why a separate service, not Next.js.* Vercel is serverless (no container
host, no persistent socket) and reaching Docker from the Next dev server
locally is fragile. `lab-broker/` owns all container lifecycle + the
terminal bridge and is the earliest seed of the Phase 2 orchestrator —
config-driven (`HOST`/`PORT`/`RZ_IMAGE`/etc., see `lab-broker/README.md`) so
it can move to a remote host later without an app-side rewrite.

*Node/TS, standalone outside the pnpm workspace, dockerode over shelling
out.* Node/TS for cohesion with the rest of the repo — `agent/` is Go
specifically because 003's rationale (static binary, zero runtime deps,
drops into any container) doesn't apply to a long-running host service.
Standalone (own `package.json`, own `npm install`) rather than a workspace
package: keeps Docker-facing dependencies (`dockerode`, `ws`) out of
`apps/web`'s install and the Vercel bundle entirely, mirroring how `agent/`
is already a separate Go module with its own CI job. The interactive shell
is `docker exec` with `Tty: true` over `dockerode` (the Docker Engine HTTP
API) — the container's *own* PTY comes back over a hijacked connection, so
this needs no *local* PTY and therefore no `node-pty` (native bindings,
historically the fragile part of Node terminal bridges on Windows/WSL).
dockerode's default socket detection (`/var/run/docker.sock` on Linux/WSL,
the `//./pipe/docker_engine` named pipe on Windows) means the same code runs
in the WSL target and was proven here directly against Docker Desktop on
Windows. The one place this reaches for the `docker` CLI instead of the
Engine API is copying `rzagent` + the check file into a fresh container
(`docker cp`) — dockerode's `putArchive` wants a tar stream, and shelling
out reuses the exact command `agent/scripts/prove.sh` already proves works,
avoiding a `tar-stream` dependency for one call site.

*Terminal WS protocol.* Client→broker binary frames = raw stdin bytes;
client→broker text frames = JSON `{type:"resize",cols,rows}`; broker→client
binary = raw container stdout (a real TTY, so Docker never multiplexes it).
Found via `lab-broker/scripts/prove.mjs` during this session: the server's
`ws.on("message", ...)` listener was originally attached *after* `await
docker.openShell(...)` — since `docker exec` create is a real network call,
the client's initial resize + first keystrokes (sent immediately on WS
`open`) arrived before that listener existed and were silently dropped
(`EventEmitter` doesn't queue events with no listener). Fixed by attaching
the message listener synchronously before the await and buffering
input/resize until the shell exists, then flushing — `server.ts`'s
`attachTerminal`.

*`packages/ui`: `ScoreLine` (first real use of the DESIGN.md signature
grammar) and `TerminalFrame` (`@xterm/xterm@6.0.0` +
`@xterm/addon-fit@0.11.0`, new dependency — the DESIGN.md v1 inventory item,
built for real now instead of chrome-only). `TerminalFrame` is a pure
primitive: it owns the `Terminal`/`FitAddon` instance and exposes
`write`/`clear`/`focus`/`fit` via ref plus `onData`/`onResize` props, but
never opens a socket — `apps/web`'s `lab-console.tsx` owns the WebSocket.
Its background/foreground/cursor/selection colors are the DESIGN.md token
hexes as literal strings, not `var(--token)` — xterm renders to `<canvas>`,
whose 2D context needs a resolved color, not a CSS custom property. The
16-slot ANSI palette (a shell's own `ls --color`, prompt colors) is
deliberately left at xterm's built-in default rather than mapped to
`--score`/`--penalty`: those tokens are reserved exclusively for scoring
semantics (DESIGN.md hard rule) and a shell's red/green is the machine's own
language, not a RoundZero scoring signal. `ScoreLine` maps a check's
`pass`/`earned` into `found`/`missed` (the Go agent has no penalty-type
check yet, so `penalty` is implemented per DESIGN.md's grammar but unused
by this feature).

*Score enrichment stays server-side.* `apps/web/src/app/app/lab/actions.ts`'s
`scoreLab` takes the broker's raw report (id/title/skillNode/points/earned/
pass/detail) and resolves each `skillNode` against Prisma
(`SkillNode.parent.title` for the category chip, `LessonSkill` for a
published lesson link) the same way `checklists/[id]/page.tsx` already does
— the taxonomy spine (CLAUDE.md rule 2) stays the single source for
category/lesson mapping; `lab-broker` itself never touches the app DB.

*Browser talks to the broker two ways.* The terminal WebSocket connects
**directly** from the browser to `LAB_BROKER_URL` (a WebSocket can't be
proxied through a Vercel serverless function, and this feature is
local-only anyway) — `launchLab()` hands back the exact `ws://` URL derived
server-side so `LAB_BROKER_URL` itself never has to be a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` var.
Lifecycle/score calls (`POST /labs`, `POST /labs/:id/score`, `DELETE
/labs/:id`) go through Next server actions instead, both to keep the broker
URL server-side and because scoring needs the Prisma enrichment above. No
CORS handling in `lab-broker`: the JSON endpoints are server-to-server and
the WebSocket protocol isn't subject to CORS.

*Local-only — does not work on the Vercel deploy.* `apps/web` builds and
deploys exactly as before with `LAB_BROKER_URL` unset; `/app/lab` renders a
designed "lab isn't configured" error state instead of crashing. Verified:
`pnpm build` with the same placeholder env vars CI uses (no
`LAB_BROKER_URL`) succeeds and includes the `/app/lab` route. Production is
unblocked only by the Phase 2 orchestrator running on a real host — not
scoped to this session.

*Root `eslint.config.mjs`* gained a scoped override for `**/*.mjs` files
(`console`/`process`/`fetch`/timers/`Buffer` as globals) — `.ts` files
already get these for free from `@typescript-eslint`'s recommended
eslint-recommended override, but `lab-broker/scripts/prove.mjs` is plain JS
and has no such override, so `no-undef` needs the Node globals spelled out
by hand rather than pulling in the `globals` package for one file.

Verified end to end: `lab-broker`'s `vitest` (16 tests: `registry.ts`
lifecycle/idle-sweep bookkeeping against a fake driver+clock, `score.ts`
parse/shape against captured rzagent JSON shapes) and `tsc --noEmit` both
green, no Docker required. `npm run prove` (`lab-broker/scripts/prove.mjs`)
against real Docker + the real `linux-practice` image: launches a lab,
scores it fresh (0/100, matching `agent/README.md`'s known state), runs
`userdel -f backdoor` and `ufw --force enable` through the actual terminal
WebSocket, re-scores and asserts the total rose by exactly +22 (the two
fixed checks, no partial credit) and that both check ids flipped to
`pass:true`, deletes the lab, and asserts `docker ps -a` no longer lists the
container — self-asserting, exit 0. `pnpm lint`/`pnpm test` (170 tests
across `packages/db`/`apps/web`, unchanged — this session added no new
apps/web-side unit tests; `TerminalFrame`/`ScoreLine`/`lab-console.tsx` are
presentational/thin-glue, and the loop's real logic lives in `lab-broker`'s
own suite above) pass; `pnpm build` (root) succeeds both with and without
`LAB_BROKER_URL` set.

**028 · 2026-07 · The flight-recorder debrief (`DebriefView`): the Phase 2
showpiece per DECISIONS 010/013.** `/app/lab` now transitions into a full
debrief after a run — count-up score header, gauge strip, run-trajectory
chart, the `ScoreLine` list, and a footer that funnels missed checks into the
SRS drill. This is the new top-of-range craft reference (DESIGN.md's Screen
craft checklist) other screens get leveled toward.

*Score history is client-session, not broker- or DB-backed — and that's an
explicit, temporary choice, not an oversight.* `LabConsole`
(`apps/web/src/app/app/lab/lab-console.tsx`) accumulates a `ScoreSnapshot[]`
in React state (`elapsedMs` off a `launchedAtRef` captured on WS `open`,
`totalEarned`/`totalPossible`, `passedIds`) each time `scoreLab` succeeds.
`lab-broker` is **completely unchanged** by this session — it already returns
everything a trajectory needs per score call, and the client was judged
sufficient for a local, single-user build. Consequence, stated plainly: **the
trajectory is lost on a page refresh.** Persistent debriefs — a `LabRun` +
`LabScoreSnapshot` Postgres model so a run survives a refresh and a coach can
review it later — are deliberately deferred to the hosting/launch session;
that work is the trigger for moving score history server-side (the
orchestrator, not the client, owns run history from that point on), not
before.

*New `packages/ui` primitives, tokenized, no new colors.* `CountUp`
(`count-up.tsx`) is DESIGN.md's one expressive motion: `useState`'s initial
render is always the final `value` (matches whatever SSR emitted, no
hydration mismatch), and only a post-mount effect animates 0→value over
400ms with a `--score` text flash — `prefers-reduced-motion` (guarded against
`matchMedia` being unavailable, which jsdom doesn't implement and a test
below caught) skips the animation and leaves the correct value in place, at
rest, immediately. `RunTrajectoryChart` (`run-trajectory-chart.tsx`) wraps
`recharts` (new dependency, `3.10.0`, MIT, React-19-compatible) in a thin,
fully-controlled primitive: a `stepAfter` line seeded with a synthetic
`(0, 0)` launch point, DESIGN tokens passed as literal `var(--x)` strings
(SVG presentation attributes resolve CSS custom properties directly, unlike
`TerminalFrame`'s canvas — see 027), no entrance animation
(`isAnimationActive={!prefersReducedMotion()}`). The whole chart is wrapped
`aria-hidden="true"` with a `<figcaption class="sr-only">` numeric summary —
it's enhancement only, the `ScoreLine` list is the at-rest source of truth,
and nothing about reading the run depends on the chart rendering or
animating at all. `accessibilityLayer={false}` is set on `LineChart`
explicitly: recharts v3 defaults that to `true` and puts a keyboard-focusable
`tabIndex` on the root `<svg>` regardless of an `aria-hidden` ancestor —
without this override, a Playwright keyboard-tab audit during this session's
verification caught a real dead tab stop (focusable, but invisible to
assistive tech). Optional `activeCheckIds`/`onActiveCheckIdsChange` props
give hover **and** row-hover a shared highlight (a hovered `ScoreLine` row
highlights its chart point and vice versa) — mouse-only by design, since the
event list already has full keyboard access on its own merits (the
`ScoreLine` rows themselves aren't made artificially focusable just to drive
the chart).

*Missed checks auto-enqueue to the SRS drill.* `enqueueSkillNodeCards`
(`apps/web/src/lib/drill.ts`) generalizes the existing lesson-completion
enqueue path (`enqueueLessonCards` now just calls it) — idempotent via the
`(userId, cardId)` unique constraint + `skipDuplicates`, same as before. A
new server action, `enqueueMissedDrills` (`apps/web/src/app/app/lab/
actions.ts`), is called once the debrief mounts; the footer reports the
number actually enqueued, or falls back to a plain missed-count line once
everything's already queued (re-viewing the same debrief, or re-scoring).

*Critical-service uptime gauge: omitted, not stubbed.* DECISIONS 026 already
scoped live active/running-state polling as a known limit until the
orchestrator runs boot-capable containers — the gauge strip conditionally
omits that `Stat` entirely (screen-craft checklist: no dead columns) rather
than rendering a placeholder. Same treatment for the penalties `Stat` — the
Go agent has no penalty-type check yet (027), so it's only rendered when
`penaltyRows.length > 0`.

*The terminal stays mounted (hidden), not unmounted, while the debrief is
showing.* `LabConsole` gained a `"debrief"` phase. Entering it just
CSS-hides the `TerminalFrame` block (`hidden` class) instead of conditionally
unrendering it — unmounting would dispose the live `xterm.js` `Terminal`
instance while the WebSocket (owned by `LabConsole`, independent of
`TerminalFrame`) keeps running, silently dropping any container output that
arrives while the debrief is on screen. "Back to lab" re-shows it and
re-`fit()`s (a hidden container has zero measured size, so `ResizeObserver`
alone won't catch the reveal). "Retry" stops the current lab and launches a
fresh one, resetting history.

Verified end to end against a **real** run: started `lab-broker` + `next dev`
locally against real Docker (`rz-practice:latest` + `agent/rzagent`, both
already built), drove a real lab over the exact WS terminal protocol the
browser uses (launch → score fresh 0/100 → `userdel -f backdoor` + `ufw
--force enable` → score 22/100 → two more inert commands → score 22/100
again, deliberately proving the chart's plateau rendering too), captured the
three real `rzagent` JSON reports. `/app/lab` itself is session-gated and
this sandbox has no way to drive real interactive Google OAuth or read a
magic-link email — rather than skip verification, a throwaway local account
was created and signed in through the app's **own** magic-link API (a token
read from that one throwaway account's own `Verification` row, not any real
user's credentials), the real `DebriefView` was rendered against the
captured report data (enriched through the same Prisma taxonomy/lesson
lookups `scoreLab` uses) via a temporary, uncommitted preview route
(deleted before commit, same pattern as 019/022/027), then the throwaway
user/session/account rows were deleted afterward. Confirmed via Playwright
(ephemeral `npx`, not added to any `package.json`, per 019's precedent): the
trajectory chart's shape matches the real 0→22→22 progression; the score
header shows `22` immediately under `reducedMotion: "reduce"` (not `0` or a
mid-animation value); no horizontal overflow at 1024px (the narrowest real
Chromebook width, per 022); a keyboard tab sweep reaches "Back to lab" and
"Retry" with visible focus rings and no dead stops (after the
`accessibilityLayer` fix above); hovering a found `ScoreLine` row visibly
highlights its chart point. The dev server log confirmed `enqueueMissedDrills`
ran successfully server-side against the real dev DB. Added
`apps/web/src/app/app/lab/count-up.test.tsx` (2 tests, jsdom): `CountUp`'s
synchronous pre-effect render already shows the final value, not `0`/blank —
this repo has no `packages/ui`-level test infra and "UI gets tested by use,
not snapshots" (CLAUDE.md), so this lives in `apps/web` against the existing
vitest+jsdom+testing-library setup rather than standing up new
infrastructure for one component. `pnpm lint`/`pnpm typecheck`/`pnpm test`
(172 tests across `packages/db`/`apps/web`) pass; `pnpm build` (root)
succeeds with the exact CI placeholder env vars and no `LAB_BROKER_URL` set
(the Vercel-deploy scenario — the lab feature stays dark, everything else
still compiles).

**029 · 2026-07 · Craft pass: every screen leveled to the debrief's bar.**
Presentation only — no route/data/server-logic changes. Three parallel
audits (lessons+checklists, drill+team, app-shell+landing) found the same
handful of gaps recurring everywhere rather than screen-specific problems,
so this pass fixed each systemically as a `packages/ui` primitive, then
applied it screen by screen.

*New primitives, tokenized, no new colors/motion.* `Eyebrow` (the 11px/
uppercase/tracked/text-dim label, polymorphic via an `as` prop) replaces
seven-plus hand-copied instances of the same class string (PageHeader,
Stat, debrief-view, lessons' domain heading, checklist TOC, join-code,
drill-session ×2) — `PageHeader` and `Stat` now compose it internally.
`ErrorNote` (AlertCircle + bordered note, deliberately neutral — DESIGN.md
reserves `--penalty` for scoring, not form errors) was extracted verbatim
from team-chooser's local copy/roster-table's inline block and adopted by
both plus drill-session, lesson-check, and lab-console's error lines (the
last of which was actually misusing `text-penalty` for a connection error —
a real, if minor, violation of the scoring-color rule, now fixed as a
side effect). `Kbd` (keyboard-hint chip) was extracted from drill-session's
3 duplicates. `PageHeader` gained an optional `support` prop (the `<p
class="mt-1 text-sm text-text-dim">` description line every screen was
repeating by hand), killing ~5 duplicate lines.

*Deliberately not adopted: `ScoreLine` on checklist items or lesson-check
results.* The audit suggested both as reuse targets (DESIGN.md's ScoreLine
section mentions "checklist cross-reference" as a future surface). On
inspection, neither is a scored item — no points, no found/missed-against-
a-round semantics, just reference actions and quiz correctness — so forcing
`--score`/`--penalty` grammar onto them would be exactly the decorative
misuse DESIGN.md's hard rule forbids. Both got lighter, purpose-built
polish instead: checklist item rows gained a neutral leading `ChevronRight`
glyph (rhythm parity with every other glyph-led row, no scoring tone);
lesson-check's result rows swapped `Check`/`X` for `CircleCheck`/`Circle`
(matching ScoreLine's own glyph vocabulary without borrowing its points/
category machinery) and gained a `StatStrip` (Score / Correct) above the
list, mirroring the gauge-strip treatment used everywhere else.

*`RunTrajectoryChart` fix — the actual bug, caught live in review.* The
chart read as mostly empty on a typical low-scoring run: the Y-axis was
meant to be `[0, Math.max(totalPossible, finalEarned)]`, but the
`ReferenceLine`'s `ifOverflow="extendDomain"` was silently overriding that
and forcing the axis to span the full 0–100 regardless — a 22-point run left
~3/4 of the chart empty. Fixed three ways: (1) the Y-axis now auto-ranges
via a domain function, `[0, (dataMax) => Math.min(totalPossible,
Math.max(Math.ceil(dataMax * 1.25), 10))]` — 25% headroom above the run's
own max, floored at 10 so a flat-zero run still breathes, clamped so it
never exceeds `totalPossible` (a near-complete run still uses the full
range, unchanged); (2) `ifOverflow` switched to `"hidden"` so the ceiling
line only renders when the run's own range naturally reaches it, never
forcing empty headroom; (3) `<Line>` became a single `<Area>` (recharts
`AreaChart`) with a `var(--score)` fill at 12% opacity under the `stepAfter`
stroke, and every snapshot now gets a marker (not just found-events) —
`markerKind()` classes each point `found` (bright `--score`/`--accent`
dot), `start` (the synthetic 0-point, dim), or `rescore` (scored again,
nothing changed, dim) — so the chart reads as the whole run, not just its
high points. `aria-hidden`, `accessibilityLayer={false}`, reduced-motion
handling, and the hover/row-linking API are all unchanged.

*Font-hosting TODO (DECISIONS 012) explicitly left open.* The shell audit
flagged it as the single biggest remaining gap (Switzer/IBM Plex Mono still
fall back to system fonts), but it's an asset/licensing acquisition, not a
presentation-consistency fix, and unattended third-party font fetches were
already rejected once during scaffolding — out of scope for a craft pass,
revisit deliberately.

*Per-screen, mechanical once the primitives existed:* `/app/lab` +
`lab-console.tsx` gained a `StatStrip` (Status / Container / Runs scored —
all from existing state, no new logic) above `TerminalFrame` plus a
`border-t` separator on the action row, giving the pre-debrief console the
same gauge-context the debrief has. `lessons/page.tsx` and
`checklists/page.tsx`'s hand-rolled empty-state `Card`s became `EmptyState`.
`lessons/[slug]/page.tsx`'s inline `<h1>`+Badge became `PageHeader`,
matching checklists/[id]'s already-correct pattern (title-tier
consistency). `team/page.tsx` gained `eyebrow="Team"` (the only main
PageHeader missing one) and the `support` prop. `roster-table.tsx`'s header
went `text-xs` → `text-[13px]` (DESIGN's 13/20 dense-data spec).
`team-chooser.tsx`'s `BackButton` gained the `:focus-visible` ring it was
missing (a real a11y gap) and matched the established back-link sizing.
`/app/page.tsx` (dashboard) — the one screen the shell audit flagged as the
clear outlier, a bare `<h1>` with no eyebrow at all — now uses `PageHeader`.

*DESIGN.md.* The "packages/ui v1 inventory" list had drifted stale across
several sessions (missing Avatar/Stat-StatStrip/CountUp/RunTrajectoryChart
entirely) — reconciled against the actual `packages/ui/src/index.ts`
exports, not just appended to. Screen craft checklist gained a line
codifying `gap-8` as the standard section rhythm (debrief's dialect) now
that this pass establishes it everywhere, replacing the `mt-6`/`mt-8`
stacking half the app used.

Verified: `pnpm lint`/`typecheck`/`test` (same 172 tests — presentation-
only, no new logic to test) and `pnpm build` (root, CI placeholder env,
no `LAB_BROKER_URL`) all green. Screenshotted every screen in scope at
1280px and 1024px via Playwright (ephemeral `npx`, no `package.json`
change) against real seeded dev-DB data: a throwaway local account created
through the app's own magic-link API (token read from its own
`Verification` row, never a real user's credentials), used to create a
real n=1 team (exercising the coach-panel state), answer a real lesson
check (exercising both `CircleCheck`/`Circle` result states and the new
`StatStrip`), and drill a real due queue — then the throwaway user, team,
and all related rows deleted afterward. `/app/lab` + the debrief were
verified against a real run through `lab-broker` + Docker (launch → score
0/100 → real fixes via the terminal WS → score 22/100), confirming the
reworked chart's auto-ranged axis, area fill, and per-point markers render
correctly against real data, and that the container was cleanly stopped
afterward (`docker ps -a` empty, broker's `/labs` empty). No horizontal
overflow at 1024px on any screen. No preview-route scaffolding was needed
this session (unlike 019/022/027) since every screen in scope was already
reachable through real auth.

**030 · 2026-07 · linux-practice vuln expansion: 10 → 30.** Content wiring
only — `agent/VULN_EXPANSION_SPEC.md`'s 20 new planted vulns + 1 new decoy,
all reusing the existing 7 check types (`user`, `command`, `file_contains`,
`file_mode`, `package`, `service`, `sshd_config`); zero engine/Go changes,
zero new taxonomy IDs. Verified the spec's tricky wiring caveats live
against `ubuntu:24.04` before writing any check (login.defs's default
`PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999`, pwhistory.conf shipping fully commented, `sshd -T`
defaults, sudoers.d/README's clean grep, and — the one genuine unknown —
that `systemctl disable rpcbind.service` **without `--now`** works offline
in a non-booted container (exit 0, flips `is-enabled`) while `--now` fails
trying to reach a live D-Bus; confirmed by direct `docker exec` probes, not
assumed from the spec's caveat text alone).

*Points: 176 new / 276 total, not the spec's floated "~200/300."* The
spec's own per-item point list (8–12 each, as instructed) sums to 176, not
200 — it explicitly delegates the exact total ("the session may
rescale... whatever the total, the 4-state proof must still assert exact
sums"). Kept the spec's own per-item weights rather than padding to a
vanity round number: `totalPossible` is 276 (100 existing + 176 new), 30
scored checks + 3 decoys (33 total). `prove.sh` asserts 276 exactly.

*Two checks needed a real design call to fit the "no `all:`/`any:`
composition" engine (schema.go):* `pwquality-credits` counts the four
credit-class lines via a `command` check (`grep -oE
'^[[:space:]]*(dcredit|ucredit|ocredit|lcredit)...' | sort -u | wc -l`,
pattern `4`) rather than a single `file_contains` regex, since Go's RE2
regexp has no lookahead to assert "all four present, any order." It's
credited by the *existing* `fix-pwquality.sh` (already writes all five
lines together) — a deliberate, realistic overlap, not a bug: an admin sets
minlen and the credits in one edit. `pwhistory-remember` needed to credit
either of two files (24.04's own `pwhistory.conf` reader, or an explicit
`pam_pwhistory.so remember=` in `common-password`) — implemented as a
`command` check that filters out comment lines from both files
(`grep -v '^\s*#'`-equivalent) then searches the combined remainder, the
same "compute the effective state via a command" trick `sshd_config`
already uses for merged config. `scripts/prove.sh`'s alternate-fix state
proves the alternate location actually credits (`fix-pwhistory-alt.sh`,
demo-only, not in `fix-all.sh`).

*A new SSH drop-in trap, not just two new directives.* `ssh-maxauthtries`
and `ssh-x11forwarding` plant `MaxAuthTries 6` / `X11Forwarding yes` in a
**new** `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-devops-limits.conf` — the same
Include-order trap as the existing `ssh-permitrootlogin`/50-cloud-init.conf
— rather than relying on the (also-vulnerable) unset/stock-file defaults,
so the lesson stays "find and fix the file that actually wins," not just
"set a directive." `prove.sh`'s bonus trap-demo was extended to prove
editing only the main `sshd_config` fixes none of the three SSH checks.

*`fix-half.sh` redefined* (66 pts: uid0 12 + unauthorized-sudo 10 +
pwquality-minlen 10 + pwquality-credits 10 + faillock-deny 8 + shadow-mode
8 + sysctl-ip-forward 8) to add a genuine **partial-credit-within-one-file**
proof: `fix-sysctl-partial.sh` writes only the `ip_forward` line to
`99-roundzero.conf`, leaving `rp_filter`/`accept_redirects` unset —
`prove.sh` asserts `sysctl-ip-forward` passes while the other two still
fail, proving a partial write to a multi-check config file credits only
the check whose line was actually written, never bleeds.

Per the wiring caveats: all three sysctl checks (`ip_forward`, `rp_filter`,
`accept_redirects`) grade `/etc/sysctl.d/99-roundzero.conf`'s *content*,
never live `sysctl` (Docker owns net.* on the host); `rpcbind-disabled` is
a `service`/`disabled` check (enabled-by-default via its own postinst,
confirmed live), not a live-running check. Two existing decoys stay
untouched; the new `decoy-required-cron` (a legitimate README-required
`/etc/cron.d/backup` job) is zero-scored and fails if over-zealously
deleted, same authorization-model lesson as the other two.

Verified: `bash agent/scripts/prove.sh` — all four states + the bonus trap
demo green (fresh 0/276 with 30 failing/3 passing; hardened 276/276, 33/33
passing; half-fixed exactly 66 with the partial-sysctl proof; alternate-fix
exactly 36 across the three drop-in/alternate-location checks; bonus
confirms all three SSH checks stay blocked without the winning drop-ins).
`go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, and `gofmt -l .` all clean (no engine
files touched). Cross-checked mechanically: check-file ids ↔
answer-key.yaml checkIds are exactly 1:1 (33 each), and every `skillNode`
used resolves to a real taxonomy.yaml leaf.

**031 · 2026-07 · Forensics question bank — Part A of
`docs/FORENSICS_BUILD_SPEC.md`.** New content-as-code type,
`packages/content/forensics/*.yaml` (one file per archetype), following the
exact pattern lessons (020)/checklists (022)/cards (024) already established:
pure `parse`/`grade`/`reconcile` in `packages/db/src/forensics/` (unit-tested,
no DB/framework imports), a thin `syncForensics` glue in `prisma/seed.ts`, a
new `forensics.core.accounts` taxonomy leaf (deprecation-safe add, per
006 — the UID-lookup archetype didn't fit `file-hunting` cleanly, exactly
the escape hatch the build spec anticipated). Authored 24 questions, 3 per
archetype, each independently verified against a real command (base64/
ROT13 via `tr`, md5sum/sha256sum) run through this session's own shell
rather than hand-computed, so the "technique" lines are provably correct,
not just plausible-looking.

*The answer key never touches the DB, same discipline as Lesson's `check`
(020).* `ForensicsQuestion` (new model) stores only `id`/`archetype`/
`skillNodeId`/`prompt`/`given`/`sortOrder` — `answer`/`accepts`/
`case_sensitive`/`strip_trailing_slash`/`technique`/`why` live solely in the
YAML and are re-parsed server-side (`apps/web/src/lib/forensics-content.ts`,
mirrors `lesson-content.ts`) at grading time. Grading is a two-action split
in `apps/web/src/app/app/forensics/[archetype]/actions.ts`:
`gradeForensicsQuestion` grades one question for immediate feedback and
never persists; `completeForensicsSet` re-grades every question
authoritatively from the same YAML when a set finishes (never trusts a
client-reported correct/incorrect count) and is the only thing that writes
`ForensicsProgress` (new model, per-archetype best score via the existing
`bestScore()` from `lessons/grade.ts` — reused as-is, not duplicated) and
enqueues missed questions' skill nodes into the SRS drill via the existing
`enqueueSkillNodeCards` (no new drill-glue needed). `ForensicsQuestion` has
no per-question user-data FK (progress is per-archetype), so a question
dropped from the YAML is hard-deleted on reseed, like `ChecklistItem` (022),
not soft-deprecated like `DrillCard`/`SkillNode`.

*Grading normalization and the "close" format-mismatch detector
(`packages/db/src/forensics/grade.ts`), the actual design problem in this
session.* Trim always applies; case-folding and trailing-slash stripping are
per-question (`case_sensitive`/`strip_trailing_slash` in the YAML), matching
real CyberPatriot answer keys' genuine inconsistency about both. A "close"
result (right content, wrong format) carries a `FormatDiff` naming which
axis — case, trailing slash, internal whitespace — actually differs, so the
UI can teach the answer-format discipline specifically instead of a flat
"incorrect." The first implementation attempt flipped one axis at a time
from the question's own strict settings and re-compared; that only
correctly attributes a mismatch when exactly one axis differs — a compound
mismatch (wrong case AND a stray trailing slash at once) silently produced
all-`false` diff flags, since relaxing just one axis while holding the
others strict doesn't resolve a compound difference. Fixed by testing each
axis independently with the *other two* axes held maximally lenient (case-
insensitive, trailing slash stripped, whitespace collapsed) and only the
axis under test kept at its real strictness — this isolates each
contributing axis regardless of how many differ at once. Caught by a unit
test asserting all three flags true for a submission that differs on all
three axes simultaneously; the bug reproduced exactly as predicted before
the fix (all three false) and was verified fixed after.

*Schema.* Two additive models, one migration
(`add_forensics_question_progress`): `ForensicsQuestion` (indexed by
`archetype`) and `ForensicsProgress` (`@@unique([userId, archetype])`, best
score only — retakes never lower it, same as lessons). `ForensicsArchetype`
is a Prisma enum (8 values), not a bare string — matches the codebase's own
convention for every other bounded categorical field (`NodeKind`,
`TrackLevel`, `CardType`, `OS`, `EventKind`), a deliberate deviation from
this session's own initial plan (which had proposed a plain `String`
column) once the existing pattern was checked. `FORENSICS_ARCHETYPES` in
`packages/db/src/forensics/parse.ts` is the single source of truth mapping
each archetype's kebab-case key (content YAML, `/app/forensics/[archetype]`
route) to its enum value and display label.

*Surface.* `/app/forensics` lists all 8 sets with per-user best score
(mirrors `lessons/page.tsx`'s list-row pattern exactly, including the
`CircleCheck`/`Circle` glyph vocabulary — deliberately not `ScoreLine`, per
029's reasoning: a quiz-correctness list isn't a scored-round item).
`[archetype]/forensics-quiz.tsx` runs one question at a time — prompt +
`given` (a mono evidence block) → answer input → submit → feedback
(`CircleCheck`/`AlertCircle`/`Circle` for correct/close/incorrect, all
plain — `AlertCircle` in `text-accent` for "close" is a restrained,
non-decorative use: a format warning, not a score) → technique + why → next
→ a StatStrip summary at the end, matching lesson-check's score-color
threshold convention (`text-score` ≥70%, else `text-penalty`). The queue is
frozen via `useRef` on mount, same reasoning as `DrillSession` (025): the
final "See results" submission revalidates `/app/forensics/[archetype]`,
and the running session must never resync from a live prop underneath a
student mid-set. No custom keyboard-event plumbing needed (unlike drill's
number-key ratings): the answer form is a real `<form>` (Enter submits
natively) and the Next/results button gets `autoFocus` on each mount
(Enter/Space activates it natively) — simpler and avoids the double-fire
risk a global Enter listener would have next to a focusable native button.

No new dependency. `pnpm lint`/`typecheck`/`test` (149 `packages/db` tests,
including 35 new forensics parse/grade/reconcile ones, + 58 unchanged
`apps/web` tests — `forensics-quiz.tsx` is presentational/thin-glue like
`TerminalFrame`/`lab-console.tsx`, per 027's precedent, so its logic has no
unit tests of its own) all pass; `pnpm build` (root, CI placeholder env, no
`LAB_BROKER_URL`) succeeds — this is pure web content, so unlike the lab it
runs on the real Vercel production deploy. Verified against the real dev
Neon DB: `db:seed` created 24 questions (plus the 1 new taxonomy node) on
first run, all-unchanged on a second run; temporarily pointing a
`skillNodeId` at a nonexistent id failed the run with exit 1 and a precise
message, then reverted. End-to-end browser verification used the same
throwaway-account pattern as 019/022/027/028/029 (a magic-link token read
from that account's own `Verification` row, deleted afterward) driven via
ephemeral Playwright (`npx`, not added to any `package.json`): answered one
question correctly (case-varied), one incorrectly (confirmed the revealed
answer), and one in a doubled-internal-space "close" way (confirmed the
specific spacing-mismatch feedback fired, not a generic "incorrect") across
the `decoding` set; confirmed the 33% best score persisted across a full
page reload on both the set page and the index list; confirmed the one
missed skill node's drill card was enqueued and live-updated the nav badge
(`revalidatePath("/app", "layout")`) without a hard navigation, and showed
up due on `/app/drill`. No horizontal overflow at 1024px (Chromebook
width).

**032 · 2026-07 · Forensics quiz: "Try again" in place, found in production
testing.** A wrong answer during a set (031) stranded the student on that
answer for the rest of the set — retrying meant abandoning and re-entering
the whole set, an inconsistent flow since re-entering DID let them answer
again. Fixed as a pure `forensics-quiz.tsx` UI change: a "Try again" ghost
button next to Next/See results (shown whenever `feedback.status !==
"correct"`, i.e. both `close` and `incorrect`) clears `feedback` and
`inputValue`, re-showing the same question's answer form (which already
`autoFocus`es on remount, same as advancing to a new question). "Next"
keeps `autoFocus` and stays the Enter-default, per the existing
keyboard-first pattern — Try again is reachable by Tab/click, not made the
Enter default, so nothing about the prior keyboard flow changes for a
student who doesn't use it.

*Reveal-then-retry, not blind-retry, and no backend change was needed.*
Considered hiding the technique/answer/why until correct (blind retry), but
`close` status exists specifically to teach the answer-format discipline
immediately (030's whole point) — hiding the reveal on a wrong answer would
undermine that. Kept the existing reveal-on-any-submit behavior and let the
student re-attempt with it already in view (retrieval practice: type the
answer you just read, not stare at it). Scoring rule: the set scores each
question by its FINAL submitted answer, not the first attempt — a
correct-on-retry counts as correct, matching lessons' unlimited-retakes/
best-score philosophy (020) rather than a first-attempt-only rule, since
this is a practice tool, not a graded round. This required zero changes to
`gradeAnswer`, `gradeForensicsQuestion`, or `completeForensicsSet`: the
client's `answers` state was already a `Record<questionId, string>`
overwritten by questionId on every submit (needed originally just to
accumulate one answer per question for the end-of-set authoritative
re-grade), so a retry's later submission already superseded the earlier
wrong one in that map before this fix — the only thing missing was UI
exposure to trigger a second submit in place. `completeForensicsSet`
re-grades from that final map from scratch (031) and was already correct
by construction.

Added `forensics-quiz.test.tsx` (3 tests, mirroring `drill-session.test.tsx`'s
mocked-action pattern): Try again appears on incorrect and clears the
feedback/input for the same question index; Try again does not appear on
correct; and — the scoring-rule assertion — submitting wrong then retrying
correct results in `completeForensicsSet` being called with the retried
("hi"), not the original wrong, answer. `pnpm lint`/`typecheck`/`test` (149
`packages/db` + 61 `apps/web`, +3 from this fix) pass. Verified against a
real run through the local dev server + real dev DB (throwaway
magic-link account, same pattern as 019/022/027/028/029/031, deleted
after): answered a decoding question wrong, clicked Try again, confirmed
the same question re-appeared with an empty input (not advanced, not
still showing the wrong feedback), answered it correctly on the retry,
finished the set, and confirmed the summary scored it as correct (not
counted as a miss) and did not enqueue that question's skill node to the
drill.

**033 · 2026-07-22 · Networking/Cisco pillar Parts A + C:
`docs/CISCO_BUILD_SPEC.md`.** First networking content session — 9 lessons,
a generalized quiz engine (forensics' quiz UI/grading pulled out into a
shared primitive, per the spec's explicit ask), a 35-question networking
quiz bank, and 27 new drill cards. Pure web content, ships to production
exactly like forensics Part A (031). Part B (the subnetting trainer) is
explicitly deferred to a later session — not built here.

*Taxonomy* (additive, 006). Five new leaves —
`networking.fundamentals.ports`, `networking.devices.ios-basics`,
`networking.devices.routing`, `networking.devices.dhcp-nat`,
`networking.wireless.security` (new `networking.wireless` category) — filling
gaps the spec identified between the existing `networking.*` nodes and what
the lessons/quiz/cards below actually needed to reference.

*Lessons* (`packages/content/lessons/networking/*.mdx`, 020's pattern). Nine
lessons — OSI, TCP/UDP + ports, IP addressing/subnetting, VLSM, IOS basics,
IOS hardening, VLANs/trunking, ACLs, static routing — each with a 3-question
end-of-lesson check. Flipped to `published: true` this session after an
in-session factual-accuracy read (same precedent as Foundations, 020) so
`/app/lessons` and a real lesson check could actually be verified; no lessons
index/grouping code changes were needed — `groupLessonsByDomain`
(`apps/web/src/lib/lessons.ts`) was already domain-generic, so "Networking /
Cisco" appears as its own group automatically. The IOS-basics lesson carries
the pillar's one scope-honesty note (a link to Cisco Packet Tracer via
Networking Academy, cisco.com's own free distribution channel — flagged for
a human sanity-check since URLs aren't a thing this session can browse to
confirm); the `/app/networking` index repeats the same note so it's visible
without opening a lesson first.

*`remark-gfm` added to `apps/web`, pinned `^4.0.1`.* Real bug, not a
nice-to-have: several networking lessons use markdown tables (port lists,
CIDR/mask tables, VLSM allocation tables) and `next-mdx-remote`'s
`compileMDX` (020) never had GFM enabled — bare CommonMark has no table
syntax, so every pipe table was rendering as literal `|`-delimited text in
the browser, confirmed live before the fix (Playwright dump of the rendered
page showed raw `| Mode | Prompt |...` text) and confirmed fixed after
(`table`/`thead`/`tr`/`th` elements present, `thead th` text `["Mode",
"Prompt", "What you can do"]`). Wired via `compileMDX`s
`options.mdxOptions.remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm]`
(`apps/web/src/app/app/lessons/[slug]/page.tsx`); `mdx-components.tsx`
gained `table`/`thead`/`tr`/`th`/`td` mapped to DESIGN's 13/20 dense-data
style. Deliberately did NOT force `font-mono`/`tabular-nums` onto every
`<td>` — table content is a mix of prose (layer names, service descriptions)
and real machine data (IPs, masks, CIDR, port numbers); mono is reserved for
the latter (DESIGN.md), so the lesson source wraps just those values in
backticks (already-styled via the existing inline `code` component) rather
than the table styling forcing mono onto prose cells. MIT, zero runtime cost
(build/render-time only), no peer conflicts with `@mdx-js/mdx@3`.

*The quiz engine, generalized (the spec's explicit C1 mandate).* Forensics
quiz UI and grading (031/032) turned out to already be entirely
domain-agnostic — nothing about `gradeAnswer`/`normalizeAnswer` or the
question-at-a-time/feedback/retry/summary flow actually depended on
"forensics." Extracted rather than forked:
- `packages/db/src/forensics/grade.ts` moved verbatim (renamed
  `ForensicsAnswerSpec` to `QuizAnswerSpec`) to `packages/db/src/quiz/grade.ts`;
  `client.ts` re-exports it under both its new generic names and its
  original `Forensics`-prefixed aliases, so forensics own
  `actions.ts`/`grade.test.ts` needed zero changes beyond the import path.
- `forensics-quiz.tsx` (the client component) generalized into
  `apps/web/src/components/quiz/quiz-runner.tsx` — the first component
  outside `packages/ui` shared across features, so it lives in a new
  `apps/web/src/components/` rather than either features route folder.
  Fully prop-driven: `onGrade`/`onComplete` callbacks instead of imported
  server actions, `backHref`/`backLabel` instead of a hardcoded forensics
  link, `given` rendered only when present (networking questions often have
  none — pure recall, no evidence block). The forensics page now binds its
  existing actions via `completeForensicsSet.bind(null, archetypeKey)` (the
  standard Next.js pattern for passing extra arguments to a Server Action
  reference across the Server-to-Client boundary — a plain wrapper closure
  is NOT a valid prop here, since only Server Action references themselves
  cross that boundary) — required `completeForensicsSet`s signature to
  change from a single `{archetypeKey, answers}` object to
  `(archetypeKey, {answers})`, its only call site. `forensics-quiz.test.tsx`
  moved to `quiz-runner.test.tsx`, now exercising the generic component with
  mocked `onGrade`/`onComplete` props instead of a mocked module import —
  same three cases (031/032s retry-flow regression guards) plus a fourth
  confirming no evidence block renders when `given` is absent.

*Storage: generic `QuizQuestion`/`QuizProgress`, forensics NOT migrated onto
them.* `QuizQuestion(id, quizId, category, skillNodeId, prompt, given?,
sortOrder)` and `QuizProgress(userId, quizId, category, bestScore)` — the
networking-quiz analogue of `ForensicsQuestion`/`ForensicsProgress`, but
`quizId`/`category` are plain strings rather than a Prisma enum (`archetype`
is `ForensicsArchetype`), specifically so a third quiz never needs a schema
migration just to add a category. `packages/db/src/quiz/{parse,reconcile}.ts`
mirror `forensics/{parse,reconcile}.ts` exactly (own answer-key-never-in-DB
discipline, own hard-delete-on-drop reconcile per 022/031s no-user-data-per-
question reasoning) — deliberately NOT collapsed into one generic
parse/reconcile shared with forensics, matching the existing precedent that
every content type (lessons/checklists/cards/forensics) gets its own
parse/reconcile pair even though the shapes rhyme; forcing a shared
mega-parser across two content types with a still-open unknown (what a third
quizs fields even need) would be exactly the premature abstraction
CLAUDE.md warns against. Forensics own tables/parse module are UNCHANGED
and not deprecated — they shipped first, they work, and migrating a live
(if pre-launch) content type for symmetry alone is churn with no user
benefit. Additive migration `add_quiz_question_progress`.

*Networking quiz content* (`packages/content/networking-quiz/*.yaml`, 35
questions across 6 categories — subnetting, ports, protocols, ios-commands,
security, vlan-acl — one file per category, `README.md` documenting the one
contract delta from forensics: `given`/`technique`/`case_sensitive` are all
optional, since most networking recall has no evidence block to show and
isnt case-sensitive). `NETWORKING_QUIZ_CATEGORIES` (ordered key/label
list for the index page and routing) lives in
`apps/web/src/lib/networking-quiz-content.ts`, not in `packages/db` — unlike
`FORENSICS_ARCHETYPES`, theres no Prisma enum forcing a kebab-key-to-enum-value
mapping to live in the shared package, so this is purely apps/web display
config, the same way a hypothetical third quizs category list would be.
`/app/networking` (index) + `/app/networking/[category]` (`QuizRunner`-driven,
mirrors `/app/forensics/[archetype]` exactly) + `[category]/actions.ts`
(`gradeQuizQuestion`/`completeQuizSet`, the latter bound the same way
forensics `completeForensicsSet` is). `next.config.ts` traces
`packages/content/networking-quiz/**/*.yaml` for `/app/networking/**`, same
as forensics entry. `top-bar.tsx` gained a "Networking" nav link.

*IOS command drill cards* (`packages/content/cards/core.yaml`, appended — no
new file, matching the existing single-file convention). 24 `COMMAND` cards
on `networking.devices.*` nodes (enable/conf-t/copy-run-start/show
commands/hostname/interface IP/no-shutdown; enable-secret/service-password-
encryption/console+vty lines/crypto-key/banner; vlan create/access-port/
trunk-port/show-vlan; ACL write/apply/show; static+default route/show-ip-
route) plus 3 small `CONCEPT` cards filling a gap live verification actually
caught: `networking.fundamentals.ports`, `networking.devices.dhcp-nat`, and
`networking.wireless.security` are all referenced by quiz questions and/or
lessons but had zero cards, so a missed quiz question in those categories
silently enqueued nothing (the enqueue mechanism itself was never broken —
`enqueueSkillNodeCards` correctly finds zero active cards and enqueues zero,
same as it would for any node with no cards — but the SRS loop the spec
asked to "wire" was a no-op for those three nodes specifically until these
existed). All content flows into the daily drill through the two existing
enqueue paths unchanged: completing a networking lesson enqueues its cards
(`enqueueLessonCards`), and a missed networking quiz question enqueues its
skill nodes cards (`enqueueSkillNodeCards`, now called from
`completeQuizSet` the same way `completeForensicsSet` already calls it).

*Seed.* `prisma/seed.ts` gained `syncQuiz`, called after `syncForensics`,
identical shape to every other content sync (parse to `validateQuizRefs`
fails loudly on an unknown/non-leaf `skillNodeId` to reconcile to transaction
to summary counts).

Verified end to end against the real dev Neon DB: `db:seed` created 6
taxonomy nodes (4 updated — sortOrder shifted for existing siblings by
inserting new nodes among them, expected), 9 lessons, 27 cards (24 + the 3
gap-fill), and 35 quiz questions on first run; second run reported
everything unchanged; temporarily pointing a quiz questions `skillNodeId`
at a nonexistent id failed the run with exit 1 and a precise message, then
reverted. `pnpm lint`/`typecheck`/`test` (171 `packages/db` + 62 `apps/web`,
net +1 over pre-session — the forensics-quiz suites 3 tests became
quiz-runners 4) and `pnpm build` (root, CI placeholder env, no
`LAB_BROKER_URL`) all pass, including both new `/app/networking` routes in
the build output. Browser-verified against a real local dev server + the
real dev DB with a throwaway magic-link account (same pattern as every prior
sessions verification — token read from that accounts own `Verification`
row via a disposable script, never a real users credentials; account and
all its rows deleted afterward): took the "ports" quiz (RDP-port question
correct, four subsequent answers wrong — confirmed "Correct"/"Incorrect"/
"Try again" feedback, `20%` final score, exactly one missed questions card
enqueued to the drill, that score surviving a full page reload on the index);
completed the `ios-basics` lesson check (100%, its 8 cards enqueued,
`/app/drill`s due-count badge tracking both enqueues live); confirmed
"Foundations" and "Networking / Cisco" both render as lesson-index groups;
confirmed a forensics quiz still completes correctly through the now-shared
`QuizRunner` (regression check); confirmed tables render as real `<table>`
elements (not raw pipe text) across four table-bearing lessons with no
horizontal overflow at 1280px or 1024px.
