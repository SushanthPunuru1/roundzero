Any change that contradicts `CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, or the roadmap gets
an entry in the same PR.

---

**001 · 2026-07 · Terminal-first labs; desktop streaming deferred.**
Linux CyberPatriot work is ~95% CLI and principle #1 is Chromebook-first.
xterm.js/ttyd sessions cut per-session RAM/bandwidth ~10x, remove desktop
image maintenance, and speed cold starts. noVNC desktops revisit post-season.

**002 · 2026-07 · Single Next.js app; no separate API service in Phase 1.**
Server actions + route handlers on Vercel cover all Phase 1 surface. The
Phase 2 orchestrator becomes the first separate service because it must run
on the lab box. Avoids double deploys/costs now. Consequence: keep domain
logic in importable modules so extraction stays cheap.

**003 · 2026-07 · Agent + injector in Go; everything else TypeScript.**
Static binary drops into any lab container with zero runtime deps; the same
codebase cross-compiles to the Phase 4 Windows local agent. aeacus's YAML
check format is the design reference (clean-room implementation, no code
reuse — license separation).

**004 · 2026-07 · Better Auth (Google + magic link via Resend), organization
plugin; one organization == one team.** Ships teams, roles, and invitations
nearly out of the box. Join-by-code implemented on top (code column on the
team). "Student belongs to ≤ 1 team" enforced in app logic. School-level
organizations deferred; will layer above teams later.

**005 · 2026-07 · ts-fsrs for spaced repetition, not hand-rolled SM-2.**
Better retention math, maintained library, pure logic we can unit-test.

**006 · 2026-07 · Canonical skill taxonomy as the data spine.**
`packages/content/taxonomy/taxonomy.yaml` with stable dotted IDs
(`linux.pam.pwquality`). Lessons, checklist items, drill cards, vuln
templates, debrief lines, and mastery all reference node IDs. IDs are never
renamed — deprecate and add. DB holds a synced index; YAML is truth.

**007 · 2026-07 · Content-as-code.** Lessons (MDX), checklists, drill
cards, taxonomy live in `packages/content`, synced to DB by an idempotent
script. Enables community PRs later and keeps DB rebuildable.

**008 · 2026-07 · Design direction: precision instrument.** Dark-first,
deep neutral base, signal-amber accent, mono as brand material. Green/red
reserved exclusively for scoring semantics. Full system in `DESIGN.md`.
Rejected: hacker green-on-black (cliché, hurts coach trust), default
shadcn look (drift).

**009 · 2026-07 · Deferred list.** Redis, R2, Grafana/Prometheus,
Terraform/Ansible, school orgs, mentor role, Discord, season ladder, AI
tutor, placement micro-task, desktop streaming — all deliberately parked
until something forces them. Rationale: solo builder, season deadline,
free-tier budget.

**010 · 2026-07 · Product renamed CyberRange → RoundZero.** Working
title replaced everywhere it appeared (`CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/spec.md`, schema/taxonomy header comments). No
functional change.

**011 · 2026-07 · Monorepo scaffolded: pnpm workspaces, no Turborepo
yet.** `apps/web` (Next.js 16 App Router, TS strict), `packages/{db,ui,
content}`. Root scripts shell out via `pnpm --filter`/`pnpm -r`; a build
orchestrator (Turborepo/Nx) is unnecessary at this package count and
adds config surface — revisit if build graph complexity grows.
Tailwind v4 config is CSS-first (`@theme` in `globals.css`), no
`tailwind.config.js`. shadcn/ui wired in monorepo mode: `components.json`
lives in `packages/ui` (the single target for generated primitives, per
`CLAUDE.md` rule 3); `apps/web` consumes it via `transpilePackages`.
Only `Button` built this session as a wiring proof — the rest of the
`packages/ui` v1 inventory (`DESIGN.md`) lands with the milestone work
that needs it. Prisma pinned to `6.19.2` (not the newly-`latest` 7.x)
to match the already-committed `schema.prisma`'s `prisma-client-js`
generator without forcing a schema rewrite mid-scaffold. ESLint 9 flat
config at the root plus Next's own generated config in `apps/web`
(pinned at 9, not the newly-`latest` 10 — `eslint-plugin-react`, pulled
in by `eslint-config-next`, throws on ESLint 10's runtime API as of
this writing);
Vitest per-package, proven with one smoke test in `packages/db`. CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `prisma generate`/lint/test/build only
— no `prisma migrate dev` against the real Neon DB, in CI or during
scaffolding, since that's a live shared resource and creating the
initial migration belongs with next session's auth/teams work.

**012 · 2026-07 · Switzer/IBM Plex Mono not yet self-hosted.**
`globals.css` wires the `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` token names to
system-font fallback stacks with a TODO. Fetching and licensing the
actual Fontshare/IBM Plex Mono font files is follow-up work, not
something to fetch from a third-party CDN unattended during scaffolding.

**013 · 2026-07 · Design exploration verdict. Precision-instrument
hypothesis VALIDATED — all strong outputs stayed inside DESIGN.md
tokens. Adopted: (a) 2a 'flight recorder' as the Phase 2 debrief-page
target: run-trajectory chart (points over elapsed time, penalty drops,
critical-service outage bands), timestamped event log, gauge strip
incl. critical-service uptime %, seed shown in header. Chart is
enhancement only — the event log is the at-rest source of truth; all
chart/log interactions require keyboard parity. Phase 2 data
requirement: persist per-check timestamps and critical-service uptime.
(b) 1b 'field datasheet' (warm light assessment-record) as the
PRINT-SURFACE identity for checklist export and readiness PDF.

**014 · 2026-07 · Better Auth wired live: pinned dependency versions +
magic-link sender.** `better-auth@1.6.23`, `@better-auth/cli@1.4.21` (dev
dep, used one-off for schema generation, not a persistent script),
`resend@6.17.2`, `zod@4.4.3`. Extends 004 (Google + magic link via Resend,
organization plugin, one org == one team) with concrete versions. Magic-link
sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's shared dev sender) for now —
it only delivers to the Resend account owner, which is enough to prove the
flow end to end; swap for a verified domain sender before onboarding real
users. `user`/`organization`/`member` APP FIELDS (see schema.prisma) are
declared as Better Auth `additionalFields` with `input: false` so they can
never be set through the public auth API — they stay system/coach-owned.
Reconciled the hand-written Prisma schema against `@better-auth/cli
generate` output (run against a scratch file, never applied directly): the
generator agreed with every hand-written model and APP FIELD; the only
real delta was a missing `@@index([identifier])` on `Verification`, now
added. First migration (`init_auth`) applied to the dev Neon DB.

**015 · 2026-07 · `dotenv-cli` added to load the root `.env` for local-only,
DB/env-dependent scripts.** Next.js and the Prisma CLI only read `.env`
files from their own package directory, not a monorepo root, so
`apps/web`'s `dev` script and `packages/db`'s `migrate`/`seed` scripts
couldn't see the root `.env` (`prisma validate` failed with "Environment
variable not found" before this). Wrapped only those three scripts with
`dotenv -e ../../.env --`; deliberately left `generate` (packages/db) and
`build`/`test` (apps/web) untouched since CI invokes them with real env
vars injected directly, not a `.env` file, and requiring one would break
CI. Root `.env` stays the single source of truth — no duplicated secrets.

**016 · 2026-07 · Team create/join/roster built as Prisma-direct server
actions, not the organization plugin's REST endpoints.** Extends 004.
The plugin's default RBAC (owner/admin/member) and invitation flow don't
match our coach/captain/member roles or join-by-code UX, and 004 already
scoped join-by-code and the one-team-per-user rule as app logic on top of
the plugin's schema — so `createTeam`/`joinTeam`/roster-management actions
write `Organization`/`Member` via Prisma directly, gated by
`auth.api.getSession` + a hand-rolled permission check
(`apps/web/src/lib/teams.ts`), instead of `auth.api.createOrganization` /
`addMember`. `auth.ts` is untouched. A user's team is resolved by
`Member.userId` (at most one row, per 004), so `Session.activeOrganizationId`
stays unused this milestone — revisit if we ever need multi-team switching.
No new dependency: the machine-role/division pickers are a tokenized native
`<select>` (`packages/ui` `Select`) and member removal uses an inline
two-step confirm, both avoiding Radix Select/Dialog. Added to
`packages/ui`: `Card`, `Badge`, `Select`, `PageHeader` (DESIGN.md v1
inventory, tokenized, no new colors). `packages/db` now re-exports the
`Division`/`MachineRole` Prisma enums so `apps/web` doesn't need its own
`@prisma/client` dependency just for types.

**017 · 2026-07 · Three bugs fixed post-016: roster machine-role revert,
magic-link always-invalid, Google sign-in dropping the account name.**

*Machine-role revert.* The DB write always succeeded (confirmed by querying
Postgres directly after the action); the select just visually snapped back.
Root cause was two-layered: react-dom calls `requestFormReset` as part of
submitting any `<form action={fn}>` (`startHostTransition` in
react-dom-client), which does a native `HTMLFormElement.reset()` — that
resets *every* control in the form back to its HTML-declared default
(first `<option>`, here "Unassigned") regardless of React's `value` prop,
because it bypasses React's reconciliation entirely. Making the `<select>`
controlled alone didn't fix it (verified: still reverted) since React only
re-writes a controlled value when its own `value` prop differs from the
prior *render*, and the native reset happens outside that diff. Fix: the
machine-role control no longer renders a `<form action={fn}>` submitted via
`requestSubmit()` — it calls the `useActionState` dispatch function directly
from `onChange` (wrapped in `startTransition`, since the dispatch isn't
auto-transitioned outside a form/button `action` prop), which never invokes
`startHostTransition`'s reset path. Promote/remove kept their `<form>`s —
their only field is a `value`-controlled hidden input, immune to this.
Added `apps/web/src/app/app/team/roster-table.test.tsx`
(`@testing-library/react` + `jsdom`, new devDependencies — free/MIT, no
Next-specific test runner existed for component-level React behavior)
asserting the select keeps a newly-chosen value after the mocked action
resolves; confirmed it fails against the pre-fix code before restoring the
fix, so it's a real regression guard.

*Magic link always `INVALID_TOKEN`.* The email pointed straight at the
API's GET verify endpoint, which consumes the (single-use) token on the
first request to it — email clients and corporate gateways routinely
prefetch/scan links before the user clicks, consuming it first. Fixed by
routing the email link at a new app page (`/magic-link`) instead; the
token-consuming fetch now happens from client-side JS on user page-load
(`magic-link-confirm.tsx`), which scanners generally don't execute. Verified
directly: a plain `curl` GET against the new link left the token unconsumed
in `Verification`; a real (JS-executing) browser hit afterward still signed
in successfully. The confirm page omits `callbackURL` on its own verify
call specifically because Better Auth returns JSON instead of redirecting
when it's absent (`callback.mjs`) — that's what lets success/failure be
told apart from `fetch` without following/parsing a redirect. Guarded with
a `useRef` against React Strict Mode's dev double-invoke of effects, which
would otherwise burn the token on the throwaway first pass.
`buildMagicLinkConfirmUrl` (`auth-helpers.ts`) is unit-tested.

**018 · 2026-07 · `yaml` (eemeli, MIT) added to `packages/db`, pinned to
`2.9.0`.** Needed to parse `packages/content/taxonomy/taxonomy.yaml` for the
taxonomy sync script (`prisma/seed.ts`, wired to `pnpm db:seed`), which
replaces the seed stub left in place during scaffolding (011). Ships its own
TS types, so no `@types` package. Parsing and validation
(`src/taxonomy/parse.ts`: dotted-id format, no duplicate ids, parent-prefix
consistency, skill `level` required/valid) and the create/update/deprecate
diff against existing rows (`src/taxonomy/reconcile.ts`) are pure functions,
unit-tested without touching the DB; `prisma/seed.ts` is the thin glue that
reads the file, calls both, and applies the plan in a transaction (creates
ordered DOMAIN → CATEGORY → SKILL so the self-referential `parentId` FK is
always satisfied). No `zod`: the cross-reference checks here are custom logic
either way, and hand-rolled `TaxonomyError` messages keep `packages/db`
dependency-light. Per DECISIONS 006, a `SkillNode` id absent from the YAML is
marked `deprecated: true`, never deleted; a deprecated id that reappears is
un-deprecated. Verified against the dev Neon DB: first run created all 108
rows (7 domains + 22 categories + 79 skills, matching the file); a second run
reported all 108 as unchanged, proving idempotency.

*Google sign-in showing email instead of name.* Confirmed in the dev DB:
the account had `providers: ["google"]` but `name: ""`. Better Auth only
writes `name`/`image` from a social profile at first user creation
(`handleOAuthUserInfo`); an existing user (e.g. one first created nameless
via magic link) never gets it backfilled on a later Google sign-in unless
`overrideUserInfoOnSignIn: true` is set on the provider — added to
`socialProviders.google` in `auth.ts`. Self-heals on next Google sign-in;
not independently unit-tested (would require mocking Better Auth's OAuth
callback flow, out of proportion to a one-line config fix) — verified by
source tracing (`@better-auth/core` `google.ts` / `link-account.mjs`)
since real Google OAuth can't be driven headlessly here.
